# Irrigation & Water Management
# Source: ICAR, FAO, KVK

General Irrigation Principles:
- Irrigate based on crop stage and soil moisture
- Avoid waterlogging; ensure drainage
- Drip irrigation saves 30–50% water

Critical stages for major crops:
- Rice: Tillering, panicle initiation
- Wheat: CRI stage, heading, grain filling
- Cotton: Flowering & boll formation
- Maize: Tasseling, silking

Scheduling:
- Use IMD weather forecasts to plan irrigation
- Avoid irrigating before heavy rainfall predictions

FAO Guidelines:
- Use ET-based irrigation where automated systems exist
